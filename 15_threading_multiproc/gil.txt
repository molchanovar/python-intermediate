GIL:

This is a mutex (or a lock) that allows only one thread to hold control of the Python interpreter. 
This means that the GIL allows only one thread to execute at a time even in a multi-threaded architecture.

Avoid:
 - use Multiprocessing
 - use a different, free-threaded Python implementation (Jypthon, IronPython)
 - use Python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
