Process: 

A Process is an instance of a program, e.g. a Python interpreter. 
They are independent from each other and do not share the same memory.

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Separate memory space -> memory is not share between process
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is started interruptable/killable
+ One GIL for each process -> avoid GIL limitation (Global Interpreter Lock)

- Heavyweight 
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- IPC (Inter-process communication) is more complicated

=====================================
Bonus: 

+
A new process is started independently from the first process 
Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
Separate memory space 
Memory is not shared between processes 
One GIL (Global interpreter lock) for each process, i.e. avoids GIL limitation
Great for CPU-bound processing 
Child processes are interruptable/killable

-
Starting a process is slower that starting a thread
Larger memory footprint
IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
